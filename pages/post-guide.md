Welcome to Embed Journal. This a static site map page for this blog. This page will help you in navigating through series of posts and closely related posts easily. All the post that are made in this blog are not easily accessible form the archives or form the corresponding category archives. Some times there are series of posts and not all of them are consecutive. Simply put, this page will guide you to locate what you are looking for easily. We will keep updating this page as and when series posts are made.

## Embedded Systems

#### Character LCD interface:

Here are a set of posts to help you to interface the Character LCD in various modes. This series starts with the theory behind the most commonly available LCD modules and moves on to the various kinds or interfaces and programming the controller to work with that interface.

#### Stepper Motor Interface:

This sequence of post will let you in on the secrets of interfacing stepper motors. The program is done for PIC but the logic should help you interface stepper motors with any microcontroller.

#### Make your self a digital clock:

This series gives a bottom-up approach to making your own digital clock. Its surprising how an item as simple and unobtrusive as a digital clock can provide such a challenge in building (from scratch). This series starts right form the I2C protocol and moves on to the RTC and then finally clubs them all together to give it a finished look!

## Robotics

#### Line Follower Robot:

This is the most common type of robot that is being built by students and hobbyist all around the world. Though simple, it will get you to know a lot of basic concepts involved in programming and circuit design. Here are a set of post that will walk you through the various levels involved in the building of Line Follower Robots.

  * [Programming the Line Follower Robot](http://embedjournal.com/2013/06/programming-line-follower-robot/ "Programming a Line Follower Robot")

#### Shortest Path Line Follower Robot:

This an evolved form of the Line Follower Robot. Besides having the intelligence to follow lines, this robot will remember the path it took and determine the shortest path that it could have taken by eliminating redundant moves and comes back to the source node form the destination node taking the shortest path that it had calculated. These posts will give you the logic for doing so and also help you build one for yourself.
P.S. read the first post carefully.
