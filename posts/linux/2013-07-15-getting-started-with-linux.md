Linux is fast becoming the order of the day. Gone are the days when hackers, techies and geeks were the only people who could use it. The GUI (Graphical User Interface) of the Linux machines have also improved so much that one can use the computer without having to know anything about CLI (Command Line Interface). This post will help you in Getting Started with Linux. Having the skill to work with Linux as a native environment, and being able to take care of the  day-to-day activities that you would do on a windows PC in Linux is really essential for engineers.

In this post I will list out all the websites, and books that I have come across till now.

Most start ups and many other companies today use Linux as their operating system to cut cost, as they are opensource. Also the Linux user community has contributed a lot to the development of open source tool. So you should atleast be able to use Linux as an operating system and have no issues about it to be on the safer side.

This video illustrates how the Linux operating system is built, how it is capable of having such a rapid growth rate. Also with the advent of the Android operating system (Linux based) it's popularity has almost doubled.

### **Links:**

Listed below are some useful links that can help you getting started with Linux as a user and become a developer. Keep track of all or atleast a couple of them to have grip on what is happening in the Linux world and how to be updated with the current trends.

**The Linux Documentation Project:**

[The Linux Documentation Project - LDP](http://www.tldp.org/) for short, is a very long-standing project that aims at documenting all aspects of the GNU/Linux operating system and it's associated application software. The Project is governed by the [LDP Manifesto](http://wiki.tldp.org/LDP%20Manifesto) and has a long [history](http://tldp.org/history.html).

The LDP website consists of two parts: the first part is a collection of documents, mostly the famous "HOWTO"s, but also some Guides. This collection is available in many flavours, from html for online reading to docbook source for rendering in [any other document formats](http://tldp.org/docs.html#howto). This part of the site is [mirrored all over the world](http://wiki.tldp.org/Mirrors).

**Linux Gizmos:**

[LinuxGizmos](http://linuxgizmos.com/) is a news and information website focused on using Linux and its derivatives in embedded and mobile devices and applications.

They are working tirelessly to bring you the most timely and relevant news and information on [embedded Linux software](http://linuxgizmos.com/category/software/) and development tools, Linux-friendlyA [single board computers (SBCs), computer-on-modules (COMs)](http://linuxgizmos.com/category/boards/), and other board-level hardware, system-on-chips (SOCs) and other significant [silicon products](http://linuxgizmos.com/category/chips/), and exciting newA [Linux powered devices](http://linuxgizmos.com/category/devices/) and emerging applications for embedded Linux.

**Linux Security for Beginners:**

Well this is not exactly a link, it is a [book](http://www.linuxtopia.org/LinuxSecurity/index.html).

There is a saying in the security world,

  > the only truly safe computer system is one that is disconnected from the network, switched off and buried six feet under ground.

The sentiment may be somewhat true but it is hardly a practical solution to the problems we face today in protecting servers and desktops from outside intrusion.

There are more computer systems connected to the Internet (now even things, IoT) either than at any time in the history of technology and the numbers are growing at a rapid rate. It seems that not a month goes by without a story of an intrusion in a major corporation by an intruder.

The simple fact is that there really is no such thing as a truly secure system as long is it is connected to a network. If the large corporations with expensive firewalls and talented IT staff can't always stop cyber criminals from breaking in what chance do the rest of us have?

**Linux Kernel Newbies:**

[Kernel newbies](http://kernelnewbies.org/) is a community of aspiring Linux kernel developers who work to improve the Linux Kernel and more experienced developers willing to share their knowledge.

**Linux Questions:**

[Linux Questions](http://www.linuxquestions.org/) is an active forum, where questions related to Linux are answered. Almost any question you may have (or will have), was already had and the solution was found.

So the first step before asking questions on forums, is to search popular directories and forums. This is one such place with a wide user community from all over the world. Members will not be very friendly if you post a question that has already been answered or if the solution could be easily found with Google. In any case, this is an awesome source of information for Linux user.

### Books:

These are the books that you may read in order to get started with the Unix based systems. All of them are free books and can be downloaded. Like Linux they are under the GNU GPL license.

  1. [Introduction to Linux - A Hands on Guide](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/intro-linux.pdf)
  2. [Bash Guide for Beginners](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/Bash-Beginners-Guide.pdf)
  3. [GNU/Linux Command-Line Tools Summary](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/GNU-Linux-Tools-Summary/GNU-Linux-Tools-Summary.pdf)
  4. [Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/abs-guide.pdf)

I have added the links and books that I know. It's quite possible that I have missed out some, if you know of any other books or resources that I missed out, leave a comment and I will update this post.
