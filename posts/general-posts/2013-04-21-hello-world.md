There is always a convention, and I don't plan on violating any today.

``` c
#include <stdio.h>

void main()
{
	printf "Hello World\n";
	return 0;
}
```

There you go! the age old thing to start off anything with - a hello world.

Welcome to EmbedJournal, a tech blog on embedded systems, Linux, and ofcourse some random electronics.

I'm Siddharth and EmbedJournal is my blog on things that have fascinated me over an extended period of time. I've finally managed to organise all my articles from the internet-scatter into one roof. Hopefully, this will be their final landing point.

Like I said, my primary focus would be on Embedded Systems. But that doesn't stop there, it's includes a lot of interesting fields such as robotics, computer vision, needless-to-say - electronics and a lot more that I learn on a regular basis.

I will try to document all my future projects here. Hopefully someone, somewhere will find it useful along the way. I will try to make it as readable  as possible. After all isn't that the whole point?
