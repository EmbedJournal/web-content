Books are an invaluable source of information. Listed below are some books that we feel, will help you understand the basic concepts behind embedded systems, robotics, and basic electronics. Check if you have come across some of these books and leave a comment if I have missed some good books.

We do not condone illegal sharing of copyright content at EmbedJournal. We suggest, you purchase the books from your local store or from an online vendor (book/e-book).

But if you cannot afford these books, here is a tip, almost everything is there in the internet. All you have to do is Google the name of the book along with the author names. Most probably you will get the book in the first few pages of the search.
